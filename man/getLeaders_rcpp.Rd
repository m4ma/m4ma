\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer scalar index of current pedestrian in pedestrian matrix.}

\item{state}{List with state data.}

\item{centres}{Numeric matrix with x and y for each cell centre (33x2).}

\item{objects}{List containing a list for each object. An object has
two length-two numeric vectors of x- and y-coordinates.}

\item{onlyGroup}{Logical scalar indicating if leaders must be from the same
group.}

\item{preferGroup}{Logical scalar indicating if leaders are preferred from
the same group.}

\item{pickBest}{Logical salar indicating if all or the best leader should be
returned.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to the function implementation.}

\item{use}{Whether the R or C++ implementation is called.}

\item{r}{Numeric vector with radii of pedestrian bodies.}
}
\value{
List:
\describe{
\item{dists}{Numeric matrix with distances for each cell (columns) to
each leader (rows).}
\item{leaders}{Numeric matrix with three rows for every leader
(columns). The first row is the cell of the leader, the second the
difference in heading angle between pedestrian \code{n} and leader, the
third the index of the shared group.}
}
}
\description{
Get leaders for pedestrian \code{n}.
}
\details{
Returns \code{NULL} if no other pedestrians are present, if they cannot be seen,
if they are not in front, or if no other pedestrian has the same group as
pedestrian \code{n} and \code{onlyGroup} is \code{TRUE}.
